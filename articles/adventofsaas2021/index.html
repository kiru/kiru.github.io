<div id="today" class="bg-orange-200 text-orange-800 text-2xl font-mono p-1 my-1 text-center rounded-sm font-semibold" >www.flashdictation.com</div>
</a>
<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day14">Day 14: Share dictations</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with the simplest change: Added a WIP based on <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2021/09/pure-css-corner-banner/">this</a> blog post:</p>
<img src="/images/day14-wip.png" alt="WIP" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto py-4 border-default border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
<p>Implemented the actual dictation page. The user can type what he hears and see a score.
For the score, right now I use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein</a> distance
(for non-programmers:  An algorithm which gives how close to words are). It is not the best score, but
I get a single value for free. I have to brainstorm more about what is a good metric.</p>
<p>The workflow looks like this:
<img src="/images/day14-dictation.gif" alt="Dictation scoring workflow" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto border-default my-4"></p>
<p>You can still not login in to production. I have to setup a proper production environment in Supabase, because
the URL which is sent in the mail (for the magic-link) is hard-coded. I tried to fix it in a few minutes, but
it will take longer than that. I decide to postpone it until all features are complete.</p>
<p>For tomorrow, I will spend some time to make all ui-component consistent, and test on mobile.</p>
<p>I got asked where the link for the project is a few times, added a prominent link on the top of this page.</p>
<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day13">Day 13: Add dictations</div>
<p>From yesterday&rsquo;s plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement the ability to create &ldquo;dictations&rdquo; by given a URL + text</li>
<li>Generate a unique link for dictation</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are implemented. Now I can add new dictations, and see them. It took me some time to grasp the Supabase Row-level Security feature, but once
I understood it, the implementation was straightforward.</p>
<p>The form looks ugly (as usual), I did not spend much time making it better:</p>
<img src="/images/day13-dictation.png" alt="Add dictation" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto py-4 border-default border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
<p>The login + adding dictation workflow works as expected. I should add some checks (e.g. empty values and so on), but for now, I have something working:</p>
<img src="/images/day13-add-dictation.gif" alt="Add dictation" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto py-4 border-default border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
<p>For tomorrow, I will focus on the following two items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a WIP banner (so ppl know it&rsquo;s not complete yet) (from yesterday)</li>
<li>Show dictation page, where user can type what he hears and we show a diff!</li>
<li>Fix login in production ( I can&rsquo;t login for some reason)</li>
</ul>
<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day12">Day 12: Login works</div>
<p>I have a working authentication system! Initially I wanted to add <a href="https://next-auth.js.org/">NextAuth.js</a> and Google authenticator.
That approach needs a hosted database instance (to store dictations + text). In the end, I decided to try out <a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a>. why?</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t have to host a database</li>
<li>Supports Authentication</li>
<li>Native support for Next.js</li>
<li>The free tier is good enough, the Pro tier is relatively cheap (20$/month)</li>
<li>Possibility of migrating to a self-hosted version if needed</li>
</ul>
<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/vercel/nextjs-subscription-payments">this</a> nice project from Vercel, with Stripe and Supabase integration.
Took it as a template and adapted it for my use case. This is the current result:</p>
<img src="/images/day12-login.png" alt="Login" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto py-4 border-default border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
<img src="/images/day12-login-user.png" alt="Login" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto py-4 border-default border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
<p>The UI looks ugly - since I had to adapt some css, and did not spend much time to make it prettier. What counts is, that I can login and create an account.
I will focus on having all features done and then spend one or two days on makeup.</p>
<p>For now, you can create an account and login. Be aware, I will wipe the database before I publish it on ProductHunt (or anywhere).</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I should work on the following tasks</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a WIP banner (so ppl know it&rsquo;s not complete yet)</li>
<li>Implement the ability to create &ldquo;dictations&rdquo; by given a URL + text</li>
<li>Generate a unique link for dictation</li>
</ul>
<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day11">Day 11: Login</div>
<p>I moved away from Cloudflare Static pages to <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. Until now, I only had static content, and no server-rendered part.
That might change, so I move rather now than later.</p>
<p>There are not many visible changes today, but I reorganized the code, and started adding the login components.
It takes more than a few hours to finish that, so I decide not to deploy the half-broken parts. I will complete it tomorrow and push a version.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I wrote a mail to <a href="https://innerfrench.com/">innerfrench</a> ( A french podcast, targeted at beginners. ), and got a replay:</p>
<img src="/images/day11-mail.png" alt="Mail replay" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto py-2 border-default border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
<p>This is great news! Next, I need to find some good English examples!</p>
<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day10">Day 10: Navigation</div>
<p>Added navigation to the page, visually this does not change much:
<img src="/images/day10.png" alt="Navigation" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto py-2 border-default border-blue-800 rounded-lg"></p>
<p>Behind the scene, I had to re-organize the code. The current online version is broken,
since I host the page via Cloudflare (they only support static next.js builds).</p>
<p>Next, (haha) I have to move away from Cloudflare. Maybe try Vercel or build on a VPS?</p>
<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day9">Day 9: Landing Page for Mobile</div>
<p>Continued on the landing page. Replaced the blue buttons with actual text and a logo, so it&rsquo;s more clear what each part stands for.</p>
<p>I need to add more text to describe further in detail, what every part is.<br>
I don&rsquo;t like if you end up on a landing page, and you don&rsquo;t understand what the project is about.
Nowadays, the focus is on fancy design and less text. But I don&rsquo;t see why we can&rsquo;t have both.</p>
<p>Anyways, this is the result after today&rsquo;s work.</p>
<img src="/images/day9-mobile.png" alt="Mobile" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto py-2 border-default border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
<p>I also added Plausible.io to track how many people are using the page. Let&rsquo;s see tomorrow how many people visited the page.</p>
<p>Note to me: Add Plausible.io from the beginning next time!</p>
<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day8">Day 8: Landing Page</div>
<p>Today I worked on redesigning the landing page.  This is how it looks like now:</p>
<img src="/images/day8-page-before.png" alt="Page before" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto py-2 border-default border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
<p>This is how it looks like now. It is not done yet, but almost:</p>
<img src="/images/day8-page-now.png" alt="Page now" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto py-2 border-default border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
<p>I need to add some infographics and explain what is going on. The page should be optimized for mobile as well.
Today I only focused on the desktop version. Tomorrow, I will fix the audio-player (it should auto-play and show that it&rsquo;s muted), and test it on mobile.</p>
<p>The written text should also be synchronized with the audio. I need to add a &ldquo;correct me&rdquo; button. Once that is done, I can write down the final features.</p>
<p>I am pretty happy with today&rsquo;s progress. 💪</p>
<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day7">Day 7: First week done, goal for next week</div>
<p>Today marks one week I have been working every day for at least 1 hour. At the beginning, I made huge progress, got the PoC implemented very fast, and deployed it to flashdictation.com. Now I have something working, but I need some goals for the next two weeks.</p>
<p>This project is called AdventOfSaaS - so where is the SaaS part? That is something I have been thinking about the last
two days. How to monetize this project? What I have now is a web app to practice dictation. It is not perfect, does not
work for anyone - but solved my problem. I could even extend it, such that I can paste the link to a video and enter the
transcripts and create a &ldquo;dictation&rdquo; page for that video. That way, the user can share that link. Once you land on the
page, you can see the video and an input area to type what you hear. Once done, let me correct your mistakes - as for
now.</p>
<p>So how to monetize? One way is to charge to create the &ldquo;dictation&rdquo; page and target teachers. As a teacher,
you can create a dictation page and send it to your students. They can listen to the audio once - and type what they hear,
and send it back to you. You can use the &ldquo;auto-correction&rdquo; tool to see what mistakes they made, and send it back to them - so they can correct them.
You have to pay certain amount (let&rsquo;s say $3.77/month) to create an account.</p>
<p>For the above use case, I need to change Flashdictation as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow creating a dictation page (video/audio + transcript)</li>
<li>On the main page, show a &ldquo;test dictation&rdquo; - so you know how it feels to use the dictation</li>
<li>Allow creating a teacher-account
<ul>
<li>One teacher account contains &ldquo;dictations&rdquo;</li>
<li>The number of users per dictation is limited</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Deadline: 7 days! By 14th I want the MVP (with the above features) to be done.</p>
<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day6">Day 6: Easy solution for transcripts</div>
<p>My initial idea was to create an app as follows:</p>
<img src="/images/day5.png" alt="Initial idea" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto py-2 border-default border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
<p>After trying to figure the best way to integrate the YouTube-API (I wasted already ½-hour to figure out why the API-credentials were wrong.),
I decided to give up for now (not because it&rsquo;s hard, just because it&rsquo;s too much effort for an MVP) and go further with a predefined set of dictations.</p>
<p>For english dictations, I will stick to these <a href="http://www.rainsnow.org/cshf_public_domain_stories.htm">freely available short stories</a>, and use
the videos from YouTube. Later on, I have to find other resources for different languages (maybe ask
on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/">r/languagelearning</a> ?).</p>
<p>For tomorrow these are the plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>replace the YouTube link with an audio for one of the short stories</li>
<li>hard-code the text form the short stories</li>
<li>design the proper landing page, as well as define some goals.</li>
</ul>
<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day5">Day 5: Issue transcripts</div>
<p>Started with updating the todos on <a href="https://flashdictation.com/#roadmap">FlashDictation.com</a>. Apart from that, added a
shortcut for the video-player (Key 1) for starting and stopping. That makes it easier to type what I hear without having to move my
cursor and hit the Play/Pause button.</p>
<p>This completes (imho) all the features needed to use the tool. Until now I hardcoded the transcript and the video.
Optimally, I would like the user to enter a YouTube link and type what I hear. Getting the captions from via YouTube API seems possible.</p>
<p>I spent most of today figuring out how easy it is to integrate the API. It seems doable, but I wanted to avoid adding an external dependency.</p>
<p>There are a few alternatives:</p>
<p><strong>Limited set of audio+transcripts</strong>
The alternative to YouTube links is, that I collect audio+transcripts (free to use) and allow only pre-selected ones.</p>
<p><strong>Podcast transcripts</strong>
While researching, I learned about the <code>podcast:transcript</code> tag for RSS feeds, which points to the transcript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;podcast:transcript url=&ldquo;<a href="https://host.com/1.srt%22">https://host.com/1.srt&quot;</a> type=&ldquo;application/srt&rdquo; /&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems a great way to get the transcripts of the audio.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a proper idea what is the best solution. A very simple approach is to provide a some audio+transcripts.</p>
<p>Later on, I can still replace them by something more dynamic.</p>
<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day4">Day 4: Simple correction</div>
<p>I managed to complete the simplest MVP:</p>
<ul>
<li>A video player to listen, pause and play</li>
<li>The input to type what I hear</li>
<li>One done, the correction</li>
</ul>
<p>Today I focused on implementing the correction part. Initially, I spent some time coming up with a simple algorithm but
wasted too much time. I ended up using a diff-library
(well I didn&rsquo;t think &ldquo;correction&rdquo; in terms of &ldquo;diffing&rdquo;, I was trying to find miss-matched words, which in the end is &ldquo;diffing&rdquo; duh!)</p>
<p>This is the result:
<img src="/images/day4.png" alt="Initial diff" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto py-2 border-default border-blue-800 rounded-lg"></p>
<p>There are a few stuff changes I will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>The corrections are not perfect, the punctuations should be ignored (or I can add an option)</li>
<li>The correction results are not intuitive to read (for non-programmers anyway), I will work on that in the future</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t show the untyped text (e.g. in the above screenshot everything after &ldquo;Et d&rsquo;ailleurs&rdquo; should be hidden)</li>
<li>In the above screenshot you see, I had Grammarly activated. I will disable it in the future.</li>
</ul>
<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day3">Day 3: Add video player</div>
<p>Today&rsquo;s goal was to experiment with the video player. It was fairly easy to add the player,
most of the time I spent making the page prettier.</p>
<p>The final result is:
<img src="/images/day3.png" alt="Screenshot Day 3" class="lg:w-3/4 shadow-xl mx-auto py-2 border-default border-blue-800 rounded-lg"></p>
<p>Tomorrow, I am going to add the correction logic. That should be enough to test the MVP.
The next is to add a few shortcuts to control the player.</p>
<p>With the above mockup, I can easily explain this project to anyone.</p>
<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day2">Day 2: Define MVP</div>
<p>The main goal of today is to define the MVP, e.g. more in detail and the tiny steps needed to go there.</p>
<p>The detailed tasks help me to stay focused, and not get distracted by other (nice to have) features.</p>
<p>For the audio, I need a way to show a player on my page. I will try with this component: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player">react-component</a>.
It seems easy to use and allows audio and video - so I don&rsquo;t have to implement it by myself.</p>
<p>For testing, I will use the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI4xp8qHD1MDErkqxb1dPbA">innerFrench</a> video -
especially since they come with proper subtitles, and the transcripts are free.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I want to focus on attracting more traffic to <a href="http://flashdictation.com">
flashdictation.com</a> and to this site, so I published this project to IndieHackers.com:

<div class="bg-orange-200 p-1 font-semibold mt-8" id="day1">Day 1: Setup</div>
<p><em>What I planned to do and what I did</em></p>
<pre style="background-color: white; font-size: 1.1rem; padding: 1px" >
 ■ Publish this page on kiru.io 
 ■ Get domain flashdictation.com
 ■ Add progress bar in days on the main page
 ■ Setup project on GitHub
 ■ Setup initial landing page with a simple description
 ■ Make a simple logo 
 □ Define MVP
 □ Define timeline
 ■ Publish on Twitter
</pre>
<p>How did the day go?</p>
<p>Registered domain via Cloudflare. The webpage is a simple Next.js static page (for now) that is deployed
via Cloudflare Pages. This was the fastest way for me to get started.</p>
<p>Cloudflare Pages deployment did not go smoothly. I ended up having the following error:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>19:21:05.595	export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.yarn/bin:$HOME/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/.bin:$PATH&quot;

</code></pre><p>It turned out, without any config, CloudFlare uses node version 12.18.0. To fix this I had to set the following environment variable: NODE_VERSION.
Once that was done, everything went as expected.</p>
<p>For the logo, I used <a href="https://hatchful.shopify.com/">Hatchful by Shopify</a>. I did not define the MVP yet, since the idea
was not clear to me as well. So I spent most of the time writing down what I expect, and what problem it should solve.</p>

Day 0: Launch AdventOfSaas 2021
</div>
<h3 class="font-bold text-xl pt-5" id="aof2021">AdventOfSaaS 2021</h3>
<p>Is it possible to bootstrap a successful SaaS business in 24 days? Let&rsquo;s find it out together:  AdventOfSaaS 2021!</p>
<p>My name is Kiru. Join me on the journey of this project. I will keep this page up-to-date with daily progress and any
interesting stats.</p>
<h3 class="font-bold text-xl pt-5" id="what-is-advent">What is AdventOfSaaS?</h3>
<p>You probably know AdventOfCode, where you solve a different puzzle every day. Similarly, I work on a SaaS (Software as a
Service) project every day. The time spent varies depending on my workload. This project is done alongside my usual
work. From 1.12.2021 to 25.12.2021, I pledge to dedicate at least 1h per day (with 4h weekend budget) and post daily updates here.</p>
<h3 class="font-bold text-xl pt-5" id="done">What has been done until now?</h3>
<p>This launch post was written before December, as well as the project ideas were collected. No code has been written
until now.</p>
<h3 class="font-bold text-xl pt-5" id="work">What am I going to work on?</h3>
<p>Dictatly: I am trying to improve my French. One effective tool is dictation. I would like to watch a video or listen to
a podcast and write down what I hear. Right now, I do this by hand and then go over the text to correct it.
It would be simpler to use the existing transcript to autocorrect and show the mistakes, as well as track my mistakes.</p>
<p>Few notes on the idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>I did not find a tool that satisfies my need</li>
<li>My usage is to learn languages, but it can be extended to a general dictation tool</li>
<li>Not free after the beta phase</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step is to create a landing page, which will contain more information.</p>
<h3 class="font-bold text-xl pt-5" id="success">What is a successful SaaS for me?</h3>
<p>These are the milestones I set to rank the project success in the end:</p>
<pre>
Level 0:
- Project is online
- The project is usable by me to practice French
</pre>
<pre>
Level 1:
- At least one paying customer
- At least 5 new Twitter followers
</pre>
<pre>
Level 2:
- MRR to Cover all the costs (server + domain and other services used)
- Double my Twitter follower count (new 122)
</pre>
<pre>
Level(s) 3:
- 100 paying customers
- Goes viral
- >500 Twitter followers
- Consistency: I manage to work for 24 days for 1h per day
</pre>
